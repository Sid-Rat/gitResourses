# git commit

The command `git commit` will take all the tracked changes (items added with [git add](./ADD.md)) and package them up in what is called a commit.

Commits come with commit messages that are required for each commit. You can add a message to a commit command by using the `-m` flag followed by a message in quotes.

A commit message _can_ be anything, but best practice dictates that you should use that message to indicate changes included in the commit.
